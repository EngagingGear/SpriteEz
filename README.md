SpriteEz is a program that can be used to automatically build CSS sprites into your application.
All you need to do is incorporate it in your build and it will automatically generate a combined PNG from your PNG/GIFs,
along with a CSS file to include that gives you very easy access to the individual parts.
It will also generate an HTML file that you can open up and see all the individual sprites and the markup that you need to include them in your code.

Documentation for this software, including how to install and use is to be found <a href="https://github.com/EngagingGear/SpriteEz/wiki">here</a>.
